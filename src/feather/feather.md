# Feather

Feather is the lightweight intermediate language sitting between Quill and the computer.

Its syntax and semantics are defined mathematically, using the language and conventions of logic and model theory.
In particular, we will make references to mathematical concepts such as sets and functions, which are to be differentiated from sets and functions residing in Quill or Feather themselves.
