# LLVM IR Generation

Finally, we can produce LLVM IR, an IR which can be translated into an object file for many kinds of architectures. Each construct in Quill must be translated into binary, called a _representation_ of that object. This is discussed in the [representations](../reprs/reprs.md) section of the book.
