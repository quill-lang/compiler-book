# LLVM translation

When compiling to any kind of machine code (such as LLVM IR), we must convert the abstract ideas of an "integer", a "function" and an "impl" into binary representations. We need to compute a representation for every type in a program. The exact binary representations are defined in this section.

Other implementation details, such as naming conventions, are also included in this section.
